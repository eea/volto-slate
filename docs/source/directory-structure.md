Some directories in this list also contain a `Readme.md` file with more important info, so watch out for them.

There also are some unit tests near the files that they test and having the extension `.test.js`. The unit tests are created with Jest and the Jest snapshots are in directories called `__snapshots__`.

Each subdirectory of `src/` excepting:

1. `blocks`
2. `blocks/Text/css`
3. `editor/less`
4. `editor/plugins/Table/less`
5. `widgets`

contains an `index.js` file so that the directory can be imported from other JS files.

The `/src` directory directly contains the `index.js` file which configures the addon. This `index.js` file specifies, in this order:

1. import of the `SlateEditor` React component defined within volto-slate
2. imports of the two React components used as an intermediary between Volto and the `SlateEditor`:
    1. `TextBlockView` in `./blocks/Text`
    2. `TextBlockEdit` in `./blocks/Text`
3. import of the Volto proposals in `./futurevolto`
4. import of the `slate_richtext` widget (`RichTextWidget`)
5. export of the configuration function that installs volto-slate which:
   1. sends the Volto config through all the above imports except the widget
   2. registers the addon reducers in `reducers/`
   3. registers the widget
6. definition of an exported function `asDefault` that:
    1. does a change of the default Volto block type to `slate`
    2. marks the two new block types as restricted
